Description File of the Source code for Shutter Fly Coding Challenge

-----------------------------------REQUIREMENTS To EXECUTE THE CODING CHALLENGE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DERBY: I am Apache Derby 10.12.1.1 as my Inmemory Database. The DataBase is created using the sqlcommand file in the "src" folder.
 
ARGUMENT TO THE PROGRAM: An argument needs to be passed, that is the Topx Value needs to put in the java argument window. 

-----------------------------------IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CODING CHALLENGE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INGENT FUNCTION: The Injest function gets the DATA according to attribute "TYPE" mention in the input JSON file.

DATA : Data is Stored USING IN-MEMORY DERBY DataBase. IT IS ACCESSED USING THE JSON STRING.

CALCULATE LTV: WHEN THE NEW CUSTOMER IS INTO THE SYSTEM IT WILL CALUCATE LTV VALUSE OF THE CUSTOMER AND PASS THAT VALUE AND STORE THAT VALUE IN HASH-MAP MAP FOR FURTHER PROSESSING.

TOP X FUNCTION: IT WILL RETURN THE REVENEW OF TOP "X" CUSTOMERS GIVEN THROUGH THE ARGUMENT

-----------------------------------PERFORMANCE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

1: THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DAYS THE CUSTOMER WAS ACTIVE IS CALCULATE BY USING BOTH THE TABLES BECAUSE IT CAN BE POSSIBLE THAT CUSTOMER VISITED THE SITE FIRST AND PLACE THE ORDER LATER.

2: TO STORE THE CUSTOMERS REVENEW EFFICIENTLY I HAVE USED HASH MAP.

-----------------------------------IMPROVISING THE IMPLEMENTATION----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
IN CURRENT PROGRAM, JSON  THERE IS DIRECT INSERT STATEMENT FOR STORING THE DATA  IN DATA BASE WHICH CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE BY USING JAVA FRAME WORK

ALTERNATE WAY OF IMPLEMENTATION TO ACCESS THE DATA CAN BE USING THE DATA ACCESS OBJECT LAYER.
